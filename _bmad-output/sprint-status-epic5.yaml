  overall_assessment: APPROVED
  notes: |
    All three stories are comprehensive, implementation-ready, and properly prioritized.
    Story 5.1 is CRITICAL and must be completed first as it blocks user experience.
    Stories 5.2 and 5.3 can be worked in parallel after 5.1 is complete.

  story_reviews:
    - story_id: "5.1"
      title: "Fix Ginie Panel Loading & Error Handling"
      priority: P0-CRITICAL
      estimated_effort: "8 hours"
      assessment: APPROVED
      blockers: none
      risks:
        - "Frontend-only change - low risk"
        - "Must test all error scenarios thoroughly"
      notes: |
        Story is well-structured with 10 implementation tasks.
        Error classification helper is a good reusable pattern.
        7 comprehensive test scenarios cover all edge cases.
        MUST be completed first - blocks user experience.

    - story_id: "5.2"
      title: "Wire Scalp Reentry Config to Database"
      priority: P0-HIGH
      estimated_effort: "8 hours"
      assessment: APPROVED
      blockers: none
      dependencies:
        - "Story 4.1, 4.2 (already complete)"
      risks:
        - "Large config (36+ fields) - needs careful testing"
        - "Cache invalidation must work correctly"
      notes: |
        Comprehensive coverage of all 36+ scalp reentry settings.
        Good caching strategy with 5-minute TTL.
        Validation logic is thorough.
        API endpoints follow established patterns.

    - story_id: "5.3"
      title: "Wire Global Circuit Breaker to Database"
      priority: P1-HIGH
      estimated_effort: "8 hours"
      assessment: APPROVED
      blockers: none
      dependencies:
        - "Story 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 (already complete)"
      risks:
        - "Safety-critical - minimum values enforced"
        - "Must not break existing circuit breaker behavior"
      notes: |
        Clear separation from Mode CB (per-mode).
        Good safety validation with minimums.
        Frontend panel is well-designed.
        Database migration is straightforward.
