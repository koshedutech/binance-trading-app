MONITORING METRICS
================================================================================

PRIMARY METRICS (Core KPIs):
  [*] Win Rate: Target 50-55% (baseline 45%)
  [*] Average Win: Target $50-100 (baseline $30-50)
  [*] Average Loss: Target $25-50 (baseline $20-35)
  [*] Risk/Reward: Target 1:2.0 (baseline 1:0.8-1.3)

SECONDARY METRICS:
  [*] TP Level Hit Distribution (which TP hits most?)
  [*] SL Hit Frequency (how often stops triggered?)
  [*] Whipsaw Count (false stops in noise)
  [*] Trailing Stop Effectiveness
  [*] Mode-Specific Performance

OPERATIONAL METRICS:
  [*] Daily P&L
  [*] Consecutive Wins/Losses
  [*] Time in Trade
  [*] Circuit Breaker Activations

================================================================================
MONITORING SCHEDULE
================================================================================

REAL-TIME (Automated every 5 minutes):
  - Trailing stop distance checks
  - Distance to next TP level
  - Unrealized P&L monitoring
  - Highest price tracking

HOURLY (Manual dashboard check):
  - New trades completed
  - Running win/loss count
  - Updated daily P&L

DAILY (Full analysis):
  - Win rate for the day
  - Average trade size
  - Total daily P&L
  - Mode-specific breakdown
  - Alert threshold checks

WEEKLY (Comprehensive review):
  - Statistical analysis
  - Pattern identification
  - Performance vs targets
  - Adjustment recommendations

================================================================================
ALERT CONDITIONS
================================================================================

RED FLAGS - IMMEDIATE REVIEW:
  [!] Win rate below 45% after 20 trades
  [!] Average loss exceeds $75 per trade
  [!] 5+ consecutive losses
  [!] Daily drawdown exceeds 5%
  [!] SL hit 2x more than TP hits
  [!] Trailing stops not activating

YELLOW FLAGS - MONITOR:
  [?] Win rate 45-50% (acceptable but below target)
  [?] More than 30% trades exit at highest TP
  [?] Trailing stops rarely triggering
  [?] Win rate variance >10% between modes

GREEN FLAGS - SUCCESS:
  [+] Win rate 50-55%+
  [+] Average win $50-100+
  [+] Risk/reward 1:2.0+
  [+] Balanced TP distribution
  [+] Trailing stops active
  [+] Zero whipsaws

================================================================================
PERFORMANCE MILESTONES
================================================================================

AFTER 10 TRADES (Days 1-2):
  Goal: Validate configuration
  Check: Order placement, trailing stops
  Expected: Data collection phase

AFTER 20-30 TRADES (Days 5-7):
  Goal: Statistical validation point
  Target: Win rate 50-55%, Risk/reward 1:2.0+
  Validation: Compare to 45% baseline

AFTER 50+ TRADES (Days 15-30):
  Goal: Full performance analysis
  Actions: Mode breakdown, symbol patterns
  Expected: Identify best configurations

AFTER 100+ TRADES (Days 30-60):
  Goal: Long-term consistency
  Actions: Full optimization
  Expected: High confidence, ready to scale

================================================================================
MONITORING TOOLS
================================================================================

Automated Dashboard:

================================================================================
WHAT TO DO IF BELOW TARGET
================================================================================

Win Rate Below 45% (after 20 trades):
  1. Verify SLTP order placement
  2. Check mode assignments
  3. Widen SL by 0.5%
  4. Review LLM signal quality
  5. Consider manual overrides

Win Rate 45-50% (after 20 trades):
  1. Continue to 50+ trades
  2. Find underperforming mode
  3. Adjust TP levels
  4. Review symbol issues
  5. Document findings

Win Rate 50-55%+ (SUCCESS):
  1. Configuration working as intended
  2. Continue monitoring
  3. Optimize based on TP distribution
  4. Plan expansion to new symbols
  5. Document success metrics

================================================================================
