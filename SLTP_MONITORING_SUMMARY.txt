  [!] Average loss exceeds $75 per trade
  [!] 5+ consecutive losses
  [!] Daily drawdown exceeds 5%
  [!] SL hits 2x more than TP hits
  [!] Trailing stops never activating

YELLOW FLAGS (Monitor and Log):
  [?] Win rate 45-50% (acceptable but below target)
  [?] More than 30% trades exit at highest TP level
  [?] Trailing stops rarely triggering
  [?] Mode performance variance >10%

GREEN FLAGS (Success Indicators):
  [+] Win rate 50-55%+
  [+] Average win $50-100+
  [+] Risk/reward 1:2.0+
  [+] Balanced TP level distribution
  [+] Trailing stops protecting winners
  [+] Zero whipsaw trades

VALIDATION TIMELINE
================================================================================

Phase 1 - Configuration Validation (Days 1-2):
  Milestone: First 10 trades
  Focus: Verify SLTP order placement
  Success Criteria: Orders placed correctly, no configuration errors

Phase 2 - Initial Performance Check (Days 5-7):
  Milestone: 20-30 trades
  Target: Win rate 50-55% (MAIN VALIDATION POINT)
  Success Criteria: Hit target, Risk/reward 1:2.0+, no red flags

Phase 3 - Deep Analysis (Days 15-30):
  Milestone: 50+ trades
  Focus: Mode-specific breakdown, symbol patterns
  Success Criteria: Identify best configurations, consistent results

Phase 4 - Long-term Validation (Days 30-60):
  Milestone: 100+ trades
  Focus: Consistency, fine-tuning optimization
  Success Criteria: High confidence, ready to scale

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

Before SLTP Tuning (Baseline):
  Win Rate: 45%
  Avg Win: $30-50
  Avg Loss: $20-35
  Risk/Reward: 1:0.8-1.3
  Issues: Whipsaws on tight spreads, single TP exits

After SLTP Tuning (Expected):
  Win Rate: 50-55% (IMPROVEMENT: +10-12%)
  Avg Win: $50-100 (IMPROVEMENT: +75%)
  Avg Loss: $25-50 (Controlled, same range)
  Risk/Reward: 1:2.0 (IMPROVEMENT: +150%)
  Benefits: 4x TP extraction, trailing stops, -80% whipsaws

Hourly (Manual Check):
  Review: New trades completed
  Track: Running win/loss count

Weekly (Comprehensive Review):
  Statistical: Significance tests
  Pattern: Identify patterns in performance
  Compare: Results vs targets
  Document: Findings and recommendations
