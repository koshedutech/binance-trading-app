# Trading Strategy Capture Questionnaire

## Purpose
This questionnaire captures your manual trading expertise so it can be encoded into the Ginie Autopilot bot. Your answers will help us understand your decision-making process and recreate your trading logic.

**Instructions**: Please answer each question as thoroughly as possible. Include specific examples (like RIVERUSDT rally) when applicable. Don't worry about technical precision—describe what you actually observe and think.

## SECTION 1: ENTRY STRATEGY

### What do you look at BEFORE entering a trade?

Please describe the initial checklist you go through:
- [ ] Price action/candlestick patterns
- [ ] Moving averages or trend lines
- [ ] Volume profile
- [ ] Support/resistance levels
- [ ] Oscillators (RSI, MACD, etc.)
- [ ] Order book

### What timeframes do you check?

**Primary trading timeframe(s)**: _________________ (e.g., 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h)

**Confirmation timeframe(s)**: _________________ (e.g., check 1h before trading 5m)

**Long-term context timeframe(s)**: _________________ (e.g., check daily for overall bias)

**Sequence**: How do you move between timeframes? (e.g., "First check 4h for trend, then 15m for entry signal, then 5m to confirm")

_Example answer_: I check the 4h to see overall trend direction, zoom to 15m for entry signals, then check 5m to confirm timing.
