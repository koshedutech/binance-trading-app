MONITORING METRICS
================================================================================

Currently Tracked (Per Trade):
  [*] Entry price and timestamp
  [*] Exit reason (SL hit / TP level / Timeout / Manual)
  [*] Realized P&L in USD and percentage
  [*] Time in position
  [*] Trade mode assignment (scalp/swing/position)
  [*] SLTP effectiveness (multi-TP distribution)
  [*] Trailing stop activation status

Running Totals (Cumulative):
  [*] Win rate percentage (target: 50-55%)

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

Baseline (Before Fine-Tuning):
  Win Rate:      45.0%           Avg Win:  $30-50
  Avg Loss:      $20-35          Risk/Reward: 1:0.8-1.3

Target (After Fine-Tuning):
  Win Rate:      50-55% (+12%)    Avg Win:  $50-100 (+75%)
  Avg Loss:      $25-50 (stable)  Risk/Reward: 1:2.0 (+150%)

Expected Benefits:
  [+] Reduced whipsaw trades (-80%)
  [+] Multi-TP profit extraction (4x levels)
  [+] Trailing stop protection on winners
  [+] Mode-specific optimization
  [+] Balanced risk/reward

================================================================================
ALERT THRESHOLDS
================================================================================

RED FLAGS (Immediate Review):

  [!] Average loss exceeds $75 per trade
  [!] 5+ consecutive losses
  [!] Daily drawdown exceeds 5%
  [!] SL hit 2x more than TP hits
  [!] Trailing stops not activating

YELLOW FLAGS (Monitor & Log):
  [?] Win rate 45-50% (acceptable but below target)
  [?] More than 30% trades hitting max TP level
  [?] Trailing stops rarely triggering
  [?] Performance variance >10% between modes

GREEN FLAGS (Success Indicators):
  [+] Win rate 50-55%+
  [+] Average win $50-100+
  [+] Risk/reward 1:2.0+
  [+] Balanced TP distribution
  [+] Trailing stops active
  [+] Zero whipsaw trades

VALIDATION TIMELINE
================================================================================

Phase 1 - Configuration Validation (Days 1-2):
  Milestone: First 10 trades
  Focus: Verify SLTP order placement
  Success: Orders placed correctly, no config errors

Phase 2 - Initial Performance Check (Days 5-7):
  Milestone: 20-30 trades collected
  Target: Win rate 50-55% (MAIN VALIDATION POINT)
  Success: Hit target, RR 1:2.0+, no red flags

Phase 3 - Deep Analysis (Days 15-30):
  Milestone: 50+ trades
  Focus: Mode-specific breakdown, symbol patterns
  Success: Identify best configs, consistent results

Phase 4 - Long-term Validation (Days 30-60):
  Milestone: 100+ trades
  Focus: Consistency, fine-tuning optimization
  Success: High confidence, ready to scale

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Today):
  [PENDING] Complete BEATUSDT and MIRAUSDT TP orders
  [ACTIVE]  Monitor for first SLTP activations
  [MONITOR] Track position entries and exits

SHORT TERM (Next 7 days):
  [ ] Collect first 10 trades - Validate configuration
  [ ] Monitor 20-30 trades - Validate win rate target (50-55%)
  [ ] Track TP level distribution - Verify multi-TP effectiveness
  [ ] Check whipsaw reduction - Monitor false stops
  [ ] Document daily findings - Create audit trail

ONGOING:
  [ ] Daily P&L tracking
  [ ] Mode-specific performance analysis
  [ ] Monitor alert thresholds
  [ ] Adjust configuration if needed
  [ ] Optimize based on TP hit patterns
